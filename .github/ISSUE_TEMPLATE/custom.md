### **How to fill it for a story**

Example for **“Read an account from the service”**:

```markdown
**As a** developer  
**I need** to read customer account details from the service  
**So that** I can display customer information in the application  

### Details and Assumptions
* The accounts service exposes a REST API endpoint to fetch account details
* Response includes name, email, and address  

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given a customer account exists
When I request the account using its ID
Then I receive the correct account information in the response

✅ Key points:  

- Keep the **role** specific (developer, admin, user, etc.)  
- **Function** is what the system should do.  
- **Benefit** is why this is valuable.  
- **Acceptance Criteria** follow the Gherkin format for testable conditions.  

You can repeat this for all 7 stories (setup dev environment, read, update, delete, list accounts, containerize, deploy).  

If you want, I can **write all 7 user stories fully filled out** for your Capstone project ready to copy-paste. Do you want me to do that?
